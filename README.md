# Android Messaging SDK v5.11.0

Android Mobile Messaging SDK version 5.11.0 release provides improved accessibility support, bug fixes and enhancements.


# Enhancements:
### Allow Consumers to submit CSAT Survey as soon as returned from background
SDK now allows consumers to submit CSAT Survey responses as soon as they return from the background without waiting for the SDK to finish connecting.

### Dynamically update message timestamps
An enhancement has been made to the conversation message bubble to update the message timestamps dynamically, without consumers having to close and reopen the conversation window.

### Accessibility enhancements
Improvements on the TalkBack accessible experience for vision-impaired users.

# Bugs Fixed:
- System message does not get displayed in current device language while using real time masking feature.
- Message bubble padding over 8 dp causes text containing hyperlinks to be clipped.
